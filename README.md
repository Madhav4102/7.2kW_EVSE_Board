- Supplies isolated power to all board components.
- Designed using **Power Integrations‚Äô online tool**.
- Features:
  - High efficiency
  - Integrated feedback and switching
  - Provides -14,+14 and 5V output rails.

---

### 6. **External Communication Interfaces**
#### USART Headers:
- For **debugging**, **firmware updates**, or **add-on modules** like Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.

#### SPI Display Header:
- Allows connection to an **optional external TFT display**.
- Useful for real-time visual feedback like voltage, current, charging status, and errors.
